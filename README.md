# VoiceCalls (extension)

Source for Voice Calls (auth.party) extension for browsers (currently using Firefox to test, but should work on most browsers).

## Server
Currently, `calls.auth.party` server is **not** open-source and *private*, however I plan on opening a free beta as soon as I finish creating a way to identify users, so it doesn't just broadcast to everyone
